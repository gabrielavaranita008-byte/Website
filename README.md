showNotification('🎯 Exploring Dining... Loading reviews!');
showNotification('📖 Full review: "Amazing Experience" - Opening...');
showNotification('✏️ Edit Profile mode activated!');
showNotification('🔗 Opening social profile...');
```

## 🎨 Animation Patterns

### Scroll-Triggered Animations
Cards and sections fade in and slide up as they come into viewport:
```javascript
gsap.from(element, {
    scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: element,
        start: 'top 80%',
        once: true,
    },
    duration: 0.6,
    opacity: 0,
    y: 40,
    ease: 'power3.out',
});
```

### Stagger Animations
Multiple elements animate in sequence:
```javascript
gsap.from('.review-item', {
    duration: 0.6,
    opacity: 0,
    y: 30,
    stagger: 0.1,  // 100ms delay between each
    ease: 'power3.out',
});
```

### Ripple Effects
Material Design-style ripple on click:
```javascript
function createRipple(event, element) {
    const ripple = document.createElement('span');
    // ... position and animate ripple
    gsap.to(ripple, { duration: 0.6, opacity: 0, scale: 4 });
}
```

## 📊 Performance

- **Smooth 60fps animations** using GSAP
- **Optimized CSS transforms** (GPU acceleration)
- **Minimal reflows** via transform and opacity changes
- **Efficient event delegation** for click handlers
- **Single stylesheet** for all styling

## 🔄 Browser Developer Tools

### Testing Animations
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Record page interactions
4. Check FPS during animations
5. Expected: 55-60 fps

### Debug Modals
1. Open Console
2. Try: `openModal('rating-modal')`
3. Try: `closeAllModals()`
4. Try: `showNotification('Test message')`

## 💡 Customization Tips

### Change Colors
Edit CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #6366f1;
    --secondary: #ec4899;
    /* ... etc ... */
}
```

### Adjust Animation Speed
In `script.js`, change `duration` values:
```javascript
gsap.from(element, {
    duration: 0.6,  // Change this value
    // ...
});
```

### Modify Modal Styling
Edit `.modal` class in `styles.css`:
```css
.modal {
    width: 90%;
    max-width: 500px;
    /* ... customize ... */
}
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- External image links (Unsplash) require internet connection
- Some animations depend on modern CSS (backdrop-filter may not work on older browsers)
- GSAP library loaded from CDN (requires internet)
- Mobile responsiveness optimized for tablets and desktop

## 📚 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Grid, flexbox, gradients, transforms, animations
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - DOM manipulation, event handling
- **GSAP 3.12.2** - Advanced animation library
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0** - Icon library (CDN)
